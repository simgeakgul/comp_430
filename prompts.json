      "Evasion attacks are test-time attacks where an adversary modifies an input instance to avoid detection by a deployed machine learning model. Without changing the model or the training data, the attacker perturbs a malicious input x into a slightly altered version that the model misclassifies as benign. This type of attack exploits the model’s decision boundary by carefully pushing inputs just enough to cross into the “safe” classification zone—allowing threats like spam or malware to bypass the system unnoticed. Heuristic attack methods aim to generate adversarial examples by leveraging gradients or feature importance. The Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) perturbs input x in the direction that maximizes the model is loss, using the gradient of the loss with respect to x. Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) extends FGSM by applying this process iteratively, taking small steps while projecting the result back within an allowed perturbation range. Jacobian Saliency Map Attack (JSMA), on the other hand, constructs a saliency map to identify the most influential features for a target class and selectively perturbs those, making it a more targeted approach based on feature importance. I am confused by the topics, could you explain them more simple and with examples?",
